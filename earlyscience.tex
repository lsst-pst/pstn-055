\subsection{Early Science Options}\label{q:Early}
Early science recommendations include and overlap with recommendations on prioritization of sky coverage and survey-specific choices that may be adopted in year 1, when for the most part the surveyed sky will not have templates or will have substandard templates, leading to the first data release that will process the initial six months of LSST data. 

While this recommendation is within the purview of the SCOC, producing a meaningful and informed recommendation that can be implemented effectively requires close interaction with the Commissioning and Operation teams of Rubin LSST (see also \citeds{rtn-011}).

As such, we defer a  recommendation on early science to 2023, during which time the SCOC will formulate a detailed plan for interaction with the Operations team. At this stage, we see benefits in implementing a survey strategy that is specific to year 1 that allows for optimal generation of templates (for example trading more filters for less sky area or vice versa) so that alerts can be released before the first data release. The details of the strategies that optimize early science while also ensuring high throughput for the survey as a whole can only be finalized through interaction between the SCOC and Rubin Operations team.
